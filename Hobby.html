                <p span class="column">Allison is a teacher, entrepreneur, and Disney aficionado. When she’s not in the classroom she spends time with her family and friends. In fact, family is so important to her that she is, at the time of this writing, in the process of adopting a child! How exciting! When she’s not with her family or taking a dip in the pool, she like to have some fun with the girls. From fine to shopping and to Disney for both, she and her friends know how to live it up.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p span class="column">With all the hustle and bustle of modern life, Allison still finds time for herself. There’s so many shows and movies to binge watch on streaming sites like Netflix that she can’t even pick a favorite. Speaking of favorites, she also loves Sushi, and her favorite restaurant is Mellow Mushroom. Her favorite menu items from Mellow Mushroom are the pretzel bites with beer cheese and the buffalo chicken pizza.</p>

                    class="column" alt="Customers can then order these shirts." />
                <p span class="column">Somehow, despite her busy life, she still has time for her small business. It started as a hobby of making shirts for special occasions for family and friends. Time and materials can be expensive, and the demand was more than just a few shirts here and there. As she began making more and more, she began to charge for materials and then she had the idea to create a listing on Etsy for some of her creations. Business took off. Now she has industrial equipment to cut vinyl and permanently press it into shirts. Then she prints professional shipping labels and packages everything neatly together to drop off at the local postal office.</p>
