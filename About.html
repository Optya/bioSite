            <p>Allison McCue is a teacher, but more than just that, she is also a family woman, entrepreneur, and Disney aficionado. However, being a teacher is more than just a job. The work is a lifestyle. An abundance of time goes into planning, setting up, grading, and keeping parents informed of how their children are progressing. Allison says this about teaching, “Anyone who is a teacher knows that it is a labor of love.”</p>
            <p>Allison loves being in the classroom so much that she can’t imagine being in another role in the school. She didn’t get the strong family connection in support roles that she found in the classroom. That and being in the classroom gives her the opportunity to be there the moment the kids have the “I got it!” moment. The look on their face is priceless.</p>
            <p>When it comes to teaching, Allison loves teaching math the most. This is because of a quote she once heard: “Children don’t hate math. What they hate is being confused, intimidated, and embarrassed by math. With understanding comes passion, and with passion comes growth- a treasure is unlocked.” - Larry Martinek, creator of the Mathnasium Method. This is her direct response to that quote: “It really resonated with me because I was the child who hated math and it was for those exact reasons. It changed my view on teaching math and forced me to find a way to make children love math. If my students don’t smile and laugh at least twice during my lesson, I’m not doing my job right.”</p>
